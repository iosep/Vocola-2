New in 2.8:

* The Vocola 2 compiler has been ported from Perl to Python, mostly line
  by line except for the parser.

! The parser has been replaced with a new one that produces better error
  messages, describing what was found versus what was expected and
  visually pointing to the error.

* Some new command line arguments are available for the compiler; see
  the comments at the start of vcl2py.py for details.
