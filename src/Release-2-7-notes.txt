New in 2.7:

! Runtime errors are now caught and displayed in a more user-friendly
  manner.  (No incomprehensible Python stack traces anymore.)

! New built-in EvalTemplate, which provides a more powerful version of Eval.

* Eval is now implemented via transformation to EvalTemplate.

! User functions are now implemented by unrolling; this allows passing
  instructions like SendDragonKeys(-), not just string-valued
  expressions.
