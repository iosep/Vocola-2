New release of Vocola 2, 2.8.6, now available


    Notable changes since last announced version (2.8.5):

! Grammar rules are now [de]activated as infrequently as possible; this
  improves performance with DNS 13/DPI 14, which take a long time to
  deactivate grammars.

* Executables whose names contain underscores are now properly handled.
  For example, a Vocola file named xyz_inc_edit__routines.vcl now
  contains commands that work only with executables named
  xyz_inc_edit__routines, xyz_inc_edit, xyz_inc, and xyz.

* As of DNS 13, <_anything> can no longer match nothing.  Accordingly,
  [<_anything>], [[with] <_anything>], and the like are now permitted.
  These were previously prohibited in an attempt to prohibit optional
  parts whose contents could be empty.

* Fixed an error where include statements were not interpreted relative
  to the file containing them.  For example, "include bar/baz.vch" in
  foo/zeep.vcl now correctly refers to foo/zeep/bar/baz.vch.


    A combined installer that installs NatLink and Vocola 2.8.6 will be
available soon.  In the meantime, you may install Vocola 2.8.6 over any
recent NatLink installation by downloading http://vocola.net/v2/Vocola-2-8-6.zip then

    unzip it to a temporary location, say T
    run (e.g., double click) T/install.bat
    (re)start Dragon
