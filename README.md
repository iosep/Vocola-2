## Synopsis

Vocola is a **vo**ice **co**mmand **la**nguage &mdash; a language for
creating commands to control a computer by voice &mdash; created by Rick
Mohr.  Two versions are available: Vocola 2 works with Dragon
NaturallySpeaking (DNS) and Vocola 3 works with Windows Speech
Recognition (WSR) on Windows 8, 7, and Vista.  This repository contains
the source code for Vocola 2.  While DNS and WSR handle the heavy
lifting, Vocola (pronounced "vo-CO-luh") concentrates on features and
ease of use.  In particular, Vocola offers the following:

Easy to use:

* Simple, concise command syntaxâ€”most commands are one-liners
* Easy to view and modify commands
* Changed commands are loaded automatically
* Large set of useful sample commands
* Free

Features:

* Create commands which capture any dictated words
* Use concise number ranges, optional words, and inline word lists
* Specify different actions for variable words
* Speak a continuous sequence of commands
* Re-use work with include files and user-defined functions

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should
be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by
looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is
obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and
maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project
exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough
the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger
projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API
reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important
links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if
applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
